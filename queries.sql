-- Below are a bunch of "plain English" sentences.  Your job is to take a stab
-- at translating each one into a single SELECT query.  You can write your
-- query below each "plain English" sentence.
--
-- We've written some example queries as a way to both show you how and where
-- to type your work and also as a way to show you new SQL commands, clauses,
-- or syntax where necessary.

-- **Please** don't delete the "plain English" versions. Just write your query
-- on the line below it. :)

-- The lines in this file that begin with "--" are comments.  You're encouraged
-- to leave your own comments, reflecting on things you're confused about,
-- questons you have, or anything else.  The more we know about how you're
-- thinking the better feedback we'll be able to give!
